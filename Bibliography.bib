  abstract    = {Increased national and international travel over the lastdecades has caused an increase in the global number ofpassengers using different means of transportation. Greateffort is being directed to improving the noisy environment inthe residential community. This is to face the growing strictnoise requirements which are implemented by international noiseregulatory authorities, governments, and local airports. Thereis also a strong competition between different manufacturers tomake their products quieter. The propulsion system in anaircraft is the major source of noise during relevant flightconditions. The engine noise in a vehicle dominates the totalradiated noise at low speeds especially inside cities. Manyrecent studies on noise reduction involve the use of perforatedplates in the air and gas flow ducting connected to the engine.This thesis deals with the modelling of perforates as anabsorbent. There are many difficulties in using liners in theseapplications. The most important is that there is no largesurface area to which the linings may be applied. Equally, theenvironment in which linings have to survive is hostile.Therefore, liners have to be carefully tailored in order toachieve the most efficient attenuation. The full-scalesimulation testing, which is usually necessary to define thenoise attenuation produced by a liner installation, is bothtime-consuming and expensive. Therefore, a need for accuratemodels is a must. This thesis fills some gaps in the impedancemodelling of perforated liners. It also concentrates on thosecomplicated situations of sound propagation in ducts that weresolved earlier using Finite Element Methods. Alternateanalytical solutions to these problems are developed here,which gives more physical insight into the results. The key design parameter of perforates is the acousticimpedance. The impedance is what determines their efficiency toabsorb sound waves. A semi empirical impedance model wasdeveloped to be capable of accurately predicting the linerimpedance as a function of its physical properties and thesurrounding conditions. It was compared to all previous modelsin the literature. Nothing in the literature has been reportedon the effect of temperature on the perforate impedance,therefore a complete study was performed. A new inverseanalytical impedance measurement technique was proposed. It isbased on educing the impedance value based on the measurementof the attenuation across a lined duct section. Twoapplications were further considered: The effect of hard stripsin lined ducts on there attenuation properties; and themodelling of perforations in a complicated automotive mufflersystem.

  abstract    = {Acoustic scattering matrices are used to characterize the influence of inline duct elements on the acoustic wave propagation in wave guides.When measuring the properties of these matrices, errors are always present in the results and need to be characterized to make valid statements on the correspondence between model predictions and measurements.In this study the random and systematic errors in acoustic scattering matrix measurements are investigated.Several aspects of the measurement cycle are examined, starting with the determination of the random error on the measured transfer functions between the acoustic source signal and the measured acoustic pressure.The second aspect is the determination of the random error on the scattering matrix coefficients. They are mathematically derived from the measurement data and the error has to be propagated from the data to the coefficients.This is done using uncertainty analyses and the use of linear methods to calculate the uncertainty of the coefficients is investigated.The impedance tube is an essential element of acoustic scattering matrix measurements and the third topic is a description of the systematic errors that can occur in these tubes. The effect of various systematic errors are shown, together with methods to account or reduce them.It is shown that there are still systematic errors remaining, and hypotheses to the source of these errors are discussed.In the last part, the knowledge is put to use to measure the aero-acoustic interaction present at a sudden area expansion.It is shown that the measured acoustic absorption agrees qualitatively with the models, however the deviation between the measurements and predictions are larger than the uncertainty of the measurements.The end correction agrees well with the models at high Strouhal numbers, but the scatter on the measurements at lower Strouhal numbers is too large to identify flow-acoustic interaction effects on the end correction. },
